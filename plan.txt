Need:

Ball
    - Move with keypress
    - ball can move left or right any time
    - ball can move down if there is a gap in the line


Lines:
    - constantly moving up the screen
    - move up the screen faster as time goes on - how to track time:
        var start = new Date();
        var elapsed = new Date() - start;
        Check elapsed time each second
    - If time > 10s:
        speed ++
    - have random gaps in the lines - search weighted random
    - maybe have a grid system

Score:
    - Number of rows the ball passes through
